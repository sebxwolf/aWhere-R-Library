\usage{
agronomic_values_fields(field_id, day_start, day_end,
  accumulation_start_date = "", gdd_method = "standard",
  gdd_base_temp = 10, gdd_min_boundary = 10, gdd_max_boundary = 30,

  tokenToUse = awhereEnv75247$token)
}
\arguments{
\item{-}{field_id: the field_id associated with the location for which you want to pull data.
Field IDs are created using the create_field function. (string)}

\item{-}{day_start: character string of the first day for which you want to retrieve data, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD}

\item{-}{day_end: character string of the last day for which you want to retrieve data, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD}

\item{-}{accumulation_start_date: Allows the user to start counting accumulations from
before the specified start date (or before the
planting date if using the most recent planting).
Use this parameter to specify the date from which
you wish to start counting, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD.
The daily values object
will still only return the days between the start
and end date. This date must come before the start date. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_method: There are variety of equations available for calculating growing degree-days.
Valid entries are: 'standard', 'modifiedstandard', 'min-temp-cap', 'min-temp-constant'
See the API documentation for a description of each method.  The standard
method will be used if none is specified. (character - optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_base_temp: The base temp to use for the any of the GDD equations. The default value of 10 will
be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_min_boundary: The minimum boundary to use in the selected GDD equation.
The behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using
The default value of 10 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_max_boundary: The max boundary to use in the selected GDD equation. The
behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using.
The default value of 30 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API uid to use.  DO NOT USE OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  DO NOT USE OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  DO NOT USE OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (optional)}

\description{
\code{agronomic_values_fields} pulls agronomic data from aWhere's API based on field id
}
\details{
This function returns agronomic data on growing degree days (GDDs), potential evapotranspiration (PET), Precipitation over
potential evapotranspiration (P/PET), accumulated GDDs, accumulated precipitation, accumulated PET, and
accumulated P/PET.  Default units are returned by the API.

Agronomic Values are calculated numbers that can be used to show the agronomic status of a field or crop.
These figures can be used, for example, to track and predict plant growth or identify water stress.
Accumulated values allow growers to easily identify how the weather has been over the season.
Both sets of data are commonly used on small and large farms alike.  This is a very flexible API
that supports a wide variety of configurations to get exactly the data you want as efficiently as
possible. It's also designed to work with the Fields and Plantings system to reduce the amount of input.
While a planting is not required to use this API, creating a Planting for your Fields will allow you
to get the most out of the aWhere platform.
